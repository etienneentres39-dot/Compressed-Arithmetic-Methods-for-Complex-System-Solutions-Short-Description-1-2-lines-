I develop fast and accurate methods for modeling complex systems, including wave propagation, fluid dynamics, and other mathematical models. My work focuses on generating verified outputs, visualizations, and simulations that help understand system behavior clearly and efficiently.

Some of my key scientific formulas I work with include:

I provide Python simulations and calculators so others can reproduce results, explore wave behavior, and learn from them. While my personal derivation methods and mental shortcuts remain protected, shared formulas and code allow users to experiment and gain insight into complex systems.

My goal is to accelerate learning, science, and research by sharing reproducible examples, code, and visualizations. Explore my work on GitHub:
